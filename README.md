## Code Description
The code is basically a simple web application where you can input your favorite food's name, description, image url, and rank.When you submit your food, it will show a food card of it, and multiple food cards would be ordered based on their rank. You can also delete the food cards. It uses a server.js, index.html, form.js, and style.css, and concepts such as DOM, addEventListener, appendChild, removeChild, arrays, innerHTML, setAttribute, and etc.

## How to Use  
First, you want to run your server by typing node server.js, and then open you're web browser and go to this link http://localhost:3000. From there, you will see the website, you can input your favorite food name, something about it, it's image url, and rank. Multiple entries would be ordered by their rank, highest is leftmost and lowest is rightmost. You can also delete individual food cards, maybe you don't like them anymore and want to put something else new.
